## Starter for your next project

This project is a starter for your next project with [Next.Js](https://nextjs.org) + [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) + Authentication; and I used the open source [Vazir](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazir-font) font face.

In this project, MUI is completely integerated with NextJs and SSR, also it RTL-ized based on documentation's instructions and it's ready for you to use any RTL language including Farsi or even Arabic in your pages.

This project implements authentication, so that just authenticated users can access to protected pages which uses `withAuth` HOC, other un-authenticated users will be redirected to `Login` page and there's also a Register page.

This project uses [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/) for manage forms such as Login form and Register form.
